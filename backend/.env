# This .env file was generated by buffalo, add here the env variables you need 
# buffalo to load into the ENV on application startup so your application works correctly.
# To add variables use KEY=VALUE format, you can later retrieve this in your application
# by using os.Getenv("KEY").
#
# Example:
# DATABASE_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXXX
# SESSION_SECRET=XXXXXXXXX
# SMTP_SERVER=XXXXXXXXX

JWT_KEY_PATH="dev-key.key"
## For testing we need an absloute path..?
# JWT_KEY_PATH="/home/mogensen/private/georace/backend/dev-key.key"
